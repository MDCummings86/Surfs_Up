After completing the first part of this assignment, so far so good. I'm getting some different output for the summary statistics, so I'm not sure if I'm doing that correctly. # Use Pandas to calculate the summary statistics for the precipitation data

Aside from that, I was a little confused by the use of the most active station as a source of data for the histogram. Once I read further, I realized the intention was for me to use that as an actual variable in the code for querying the previous 12 months.  

A for the app.py portion. I'm wasn't able to solve for an AttributeError: measurements problem, so the API is not running. I ran out of time and it got too late to use AskBCS, so I'll have to fiddle with it and get it back working. I wasn't sure how to handle the most active 12 months, so I used the method from the climate_starter file and didn't run into any code problems.
